### Welcome to my website on the New Seven Wonders of the World! I made this website for my Per Scholas bootcamp Skills Based Assessment on HTML and CSS.

### Acknowledgements:

-I used Bootstrap code snippets and made them my own

-I used Wikipedia for content

### Reflection Question:

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I could have made a to do list with a schedule for time boxing. It would have helped me to prioritze developing features over making the CSS look good.

### Here are the 3 wireframes I created:
