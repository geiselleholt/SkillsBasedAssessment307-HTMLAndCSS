### Welcome to my website on the New Seven Wonders of the World! 

I made this website for my Skills Based Assessment on HTML and CSS for my Per Scholas bootcamp. Some of the requirements were to keep the grid system consistent between pages, use forms, a table, a dropdown, gifs, complimentary color scheme, and to use inline, internal and external styling.

We had 3 days to complete this project. If given more time, my next steps would be:
-Evenly space the contents of the header and footer
-Fix the containers for the Wonders' pages to the same size
-Fix the carousel images to be the same size
-Choose better gifs
-Choose more readable font
-Make footer fixed

I figured out how to deploy using Github: (So I could show my family my hard work)

### Acknowledgements:

-I used Bootstrap code snippets from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

### Reflection Question:

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I could have made a to do list with a schedule for time boxing. It would have helped me to prioritze developing features over making the CSS look good.

### Here are the 3 wireframes I created:
